# Student Progress Tracker
**Name:** [Erkin Menguc]
**P-number:** [P490475]
**Course Code:** IY499 - Introduction to Programming

## Declaration
I confirm that this assignment is my own work. I have used online resources for help where needed, and I have added comments in my code to show where I got the help.

## About My Project
I created a program to help teachers keep track of their students' grades. 

**What the program does:**
* **Add Students:** You can type a student's name and their score.
* **Save Data:** Everything is saved into a file called `students.txt` so it's not lost when you close the app.
* **Sorting:** I wrote a "Bubble Sort" algorithm to rank students from the highest grade to the lowest.
* **Search:** There is a search bar to find a student by their name.
* **Graph:** You can click a button to see a bar chart of all the grades.

## My Code Features (Must-Haves)
* **GUI:** I used the `Tkinter` library for the window and buttons.
* **Visuals:** I used `Matplotlib` to create the grade chart.
* **Files:** My program reads and writes to a text file.
* **Algorithms:** I implemented Bubble Sort for sorting and Linear Search for finding names.
* **Error Control:** I used `try-except` blocks so the program doesn't crash if you enter a wrong value.

## How to Run the Program
1. Install Python
2. Install the chart library by typing: `pip install matplotlib`
3. Run my code: `python erkiniy499.py`
